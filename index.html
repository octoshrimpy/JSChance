    <h3>HowTo</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Indent items in a list with 2 spaces</li>
      <li>You can have as many items in a list as you want.</li>
      <li>Pull an item from a list using square brackets around the list name. [animal] will be replaced with an item from a list titled "animal"</li>
      <li>Number ranges can also be used by using a range in square brackets [1-6] will simulate a dice roll.</li>
      <li>Nested lists will result in an array showing each level it pulled from.</li>
      <li>`parser.options` is a special object that will show all of the possibilities for a list. These are JS objects, so you can dig down using dot operators. `parser.options.landscape.natural.blue`</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Weighted items ^2 makes an item twice as likely, ^0.1 for 1/10th as likely as others</li>
      <li>Inline? generate = [landscape.[landtype].[color]]</li>
      <li>Lookahead/behind {a} [animal] becomes AN antelope, </li>
    </ul>
